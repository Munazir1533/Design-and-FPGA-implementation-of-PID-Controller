# Design and FPGA Implementation of PID Controller

## ABSTRACT

**KEYWORDS:** PID, Controller, FPGA, MATLAB, Simulink, DC Motor, Hardware Implementation, Real-time Speed Measurement, IR Sensor.

This project presents the design and FPGA implementation of a digital Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using MATLAB Simulink. The PID controller is widely adopted in engineering and automation systems for its adeptness in effectively regulating system behavior. The focus of this work is on developing a digital version of the PID controller suitable for real-time applications and hardware integration.

The design process involves modeling the PID controller in MATLAB Simulink and optimizing key parameters such as proportional gain (Kp), integral gain (Ki), and derivative gain (Kd) to achieve the desired system response. The Simulink model is then converted into hardware description language (HDL) code compatible with FPGA platforms. The FPGA implementation offers advantages such as high-speed processing, low-latency response, and potential for parallel processing of control tasks. The controller is synthesized and mapped onto the FPGA, enabling real-time control of physical systems or processes.

In this project, we chose the FPGA approach and utilized the Xilinx Artix-7 series FPGA on the Nexys4 DDR board. We controlled the speed of a DC motor and programmed the FPGA using Verilog HDL. Our design leveraged FPGA technology, with simulations conducted through the Xilinx Vivado tool. Real-time speed measurement was achieved using an IR Sensor, and the L298N motor driver ensured efficient operation of the DC motor.
